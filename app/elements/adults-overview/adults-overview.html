    <h2 class="page-title">Effects of Delayed Puberty: Adults</h2>

    <h3>What is the purpose of this research study?</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this research is to study the physical and emotional effects that delayed puberty can have on adolescents.</p>

    </br><hr/>

    <h3>Who can take part in this study?</h3>
    <p>We are looking for men and women over the age of 18 years whose puberty started later than average. For men, this means that puberty must have started after age 13 ½ years. For women, this means that puberty must have started after age 12 years.</p>

    </br><hr/>

    <h3>What would I have to do to be part of this study?</h3>
    <p>This study involves two parts. Part 1 is an online survey that you can complete at home that takes approximately 1 hour. To access this survey, please contact one of our research coordinators, Elfa or Ryan, by clicking on “Research Team” under the “Welcome” tab on the left side of this page.</p>
    <p>At the end of the survey, you will be invited to participate in Part 2. Part 2 involves one in-person study visit at Boston Children’s Hospital. At this visit, a doctor will examine your body, ask you about your physical and mental health, and perform some blood tests. We will take 3 types of X-ray pictures of your body. Additionally, men who participate in Part 2 of the study may also choose to give a semen sample.</p>

    </br><hr/>

    <h3>What are some of the risks of being part of this research study? </h3>
    <p>You may feel uncomfortable or embarrassed when the doctor performs the physical exam or asks you questions about your health.</p>
    <p>Your participation in this research study includes the use of scans that use radiation. The amount of radiation used for the scans is well below the levels that are thought to cause harm.</p>
    <p>There are also some risks that come with the blood draws that we do in this research study. You might experience some minor discomfort or bruising when we draw blood. Some people faint when they get blood drawn. There is also a small chance that the blood draw site may get infected.</p>

    </br><hr/>

    <h3>Are there any benefits for me if I take part in this study?</h3>
    <p>Being in this research may not help you right now.  We hope that the research will teach us more about delayed puberty.  This may help other children with delayed puberty in the future.</p>

    </br><hr/>

    <h3>Will I get paid for taking part in this study?</h3>
    <p>You will be paid $100 for every study visit that you complete. You will also receive a meal voucher for the hospital cafeteria, and you will be reimbursed for travel and parking costs. Men who choose to give a semen sample will be compensated with an additional $100.</p>
