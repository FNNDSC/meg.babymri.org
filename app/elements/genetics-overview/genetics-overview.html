    <h3>What is the purpose of this research study?</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this research is to find the causes of delayed puberty.</p>

    </br><hr/>

    <h3>Who can take part in this study?</h3>
    <p>We are looking for men and boys over the age of 13 ½ years and women and girls over the age of 12 years whose puberty started later than average. For boys, this means that puberty must have started after age 13 ½ years. For girls, this means that puberty must have started after age 12 years.</p>

    </br><hr/>

    <h3>What would I have to do to be part of this study?</h3>
    <p>This research study involves one in-person study visit at Boston Children’s Hospital. At this visit, we will ask you about your physical and mental health, draw a small amount of blood, and give you a scratch-and-sniff smell test.</p>

    </br><hr/>

    <h3>What are some of the risks of being part of this research study? </h3>
    <p>You may feel uncomfortable or embarrassed when the doctor performs the physical exam or asks you questions about your health.</p>
    <p>There are also some risks that come with the blood draws that we do in this research study. You might experience some minor discomfort or bruising when we draw blood. Some people faint when they get blood drawn. There is also a small chance that the blood draw site may get infected.</p>

    </br><hr/>

    <h3>Are there any benefits for me if I take part in this study?</h3>
    <p>Being in this research may not help you right now.  We hope that the research will teach us more about delayed puberty.  This may help other people with delayed puberty in the future.  </p>

    </br><hr/>

    <h3>Will I get paid for taking part in this study?</h3>
    <p>If you drive to your study visit, we will give you a voucher to cover the cost of parking. If you take public transportation to your study visit, we will reimburse you for the cost of public transportation.</p>
