    <p>Welcome to the website for Boston Children’s Hospital’s research studies on delayed puberty! We are delighted that you are interested in learning more about our research studies. We want to find out more about how and why children may experience puberty differently – and we need your help!</p>



    </br><hr/>

    <p>Delayed puberty is a common problem that affects approximately 2% of adolescents. Even though delayed puberty is such a common issue, we don’t know why it happens or if it can lead to long-term problems.</p>

    </div>

    <p>We want to hear from people of all ages who are either currently experiencing delayed puberty or have a history of puberty that started later than normal.</p>

    <p>This website will help you learn more about our research studies. For information about each of our studies, click the name of the study on the left side of the page. To learn more about who we are, click on "Research Team" on the left side of the page.</p>
