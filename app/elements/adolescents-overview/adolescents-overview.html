    <h2 class="page-title">Effects of Delayed Puberty: Adolescents</h2>

    <h3>What is the purpose of this research study?</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this research is to study the physical and emotional effects that delayed puberty can have on adolescents.</p>

    </br><hr/>

    <h3>Who can take part in this study?</h3>
    <p>We are looking for boys between the ages of 13 ½ and 18 years and girls between the ages of 12 and 18 years whose puberty has not started yet.</p>

    </br><hr/>

    <h3>What would I have to do to be part of this study?</h3>
    <p>You will come to Boston Children’s Hospital for study visits every 6 months until you turn 18. At each of these visits, a doctor will examine your body, ask you and your parents some questions that ask about your physical and mental health, and perform some blood tests.</p>
    <p>At every other visit (once a year), we will take 3 types of X-ray pictures of your body.</p>
    <p>When you turn 18, you will be invited to continue with the adult version of this study. More information on the adult study can be found by clicking “Effects of Delayed Puberty – Adults” on the left side of this page.</p>

    </br><hr/>

    <h3>What are some of the risks of being part of this research study? </h3>
    <p>You may feel uncomfortable or embarrassed when the doctor performs the physical exam or asks you questions about your health.</p>
    <p>Your participation in this research study includes the use of scans that use radiation. The amount of radiation used for the scans is well below the levels that are thought to cause harm.</p>
    <p>There are also some risks that come with the blood draws that we do in this research study. You might experience some minor discomfort or bruising when we draw blood. Some people faint when they get blood drawn. There is also a small chance that the blood draw site may get infected.</p>

    </br><hr/>

    <h3>Are there any benefits for me if I take part in this study?</h3>
    <p>Being in this research may not help you right now.  We hope that the research will teach us more about delayed puberty.  This may help other children with delayed puberty in the future.</p>

    </br><hr/>

    <h3>Will I get paid for taking part in this study?</h3>
    <p>You will be paid $100 for every study visit that you complete. While you are at the hospital for your study visits, you and one parent will receive a meal voucher for the hospital cafeteria. Parents will receive a $20 token of appreciation after each study visit and will be reimbursed for travel and parking costs.</p>
