    <h3>What is the purpose of this research study?</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this research is to develop a new test to help doctors tell whether a person will eventually enter puberty even if they haven’t started puberty yet. This test uses kisspeptin, a recently discovered hormone (a chemical naturally produced by the body).</p>
    <p>Right now, doctors cannot tell if someone who has not started puberty yet will eventually start puberty in the future. In this research study, we are testing a new blood test that may allow doctors to test children with delayed puberty to see whether they will eventually start puberty or not. Kisspeptin tells the body to make other puberty hormones, so by giving kisspeptin to children with delayed puberty, we hope to find out if the body is able to make these puberty hormones.</p>

    <h3>Who can take part in this study?</h3>
    <p>We are looking for boys between the ages of 13 ½ and 18 and girls between the ages of 12 and 18 who have not started puberty yet.</p>

    </br><hr/>

    <h3>What would I have to do to be part of this study?</h3>
    <p>If you take part in this study, you will come for four visits at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, MA. One of the visits is an overnight stay, and at two of the visits we will give you two hormones (kisspeptin and GnRH) to see how your body responds to these hormones. An outline of what happens at each study visit is below. More details on these visits can be found in the consent form located in the “Documents” section on the left side of this page.</p>
    <p><b>Visit 1:</b> The purpose of this visit is to make sure you are eligible for the research study and that it will be safe for you to participate. We will ask questions about your health, perform a physical exam, and draw blood for tests. This visit will last about 1½ hours.</p>
    <p><b>Visit 2:</b> At this visit, you will stay overnight at the hospital, from about 4:30 pm the first day until about 2:30 pm the next day. One of your parents may also stay overnight with you. We will draw blood to look at how your body makes puberty hormones on its own, then give you kisspeptin and GnRH to see how your body to these hormones.</p>
    <p><b>Between Visit 2 & 3:</b> Between visit 2 and 3, we will ask you to wear a small pump that will give you small doses of GnRH. The pump is about the size of a small cell phone. You can shower and participate in most sports during this time, but you should not swim or take a bath.</p>
    <p><b>Visit 3:</b> At this visit, you will spend most of the day at the hospital, from 7:00 am until about 3:30 pm. We will draw blood again to how your body responds to these hormones after you have worn the pump for a week.</p>
    <p><b>Visit 4:</b> The purpose of this visit is to share some of your results from the research study and to make sure you are well. This visit will last about 1 hour. We will ask questions about your health, perform a physical exam, and draw blood for tests.</p>
    <p><b>Follow-up Visits:</b> After these first four visits, you will return for follow-up visits every six months until you turn 18 years old to see how your puberty is progressing. </p>
    <p>If your family lives in New England, all of the study visits will take place at Massachusetts General Hospital. We will pay for all your parking costs for the study visits.  If your family lives outside New England, we will plan Visits 1 and 4 and follow-up visits to be done closer to home. Visits 2 and 3 must be done at Massachusetts General Hospital. We can help to pay for travel and lodging expenses for families coming to Massachusetts General Hospital from outside New England.</p>

    <h3>What are some of the risks of being part of this research study? </h3>
    <p>Some of the potential risks of the study come from the hormones we give: kisspeptin and GnRH. </p>
    <p>Kisspeptin is naturally made by the body, but the kisspeptin we give is made in a lab and is not taken from humans or other animals. It has also been given to over 200 humans with no side effects. However, there may be risks of kisspeptin that are currently unknown.</p>
    <p>GnRH is also naturally made by the body. The GnRH we give is also made in a lab and is not taken from humans or other animals. GnRH has been given to thousands of adults and children for over 30 years without any complications.</p>
    <p>There are also some risks that come with the blood draws that we do in this research study. You might experience some minor discomfort or bruising when we draw blood. Some people faint when they get blood drawn. There is also a small chance that the blood draw site may get infected. Some people feel tired the day after taking part in the study.</p>

    <h3>Are there any benefits for me if I take part in this study?</h3>
    <p>The blood tests in this research study may show that you are actually in very early puberty even though it may you look like you haven’t entered puberty yet. We will share the information we get from our testing with you and your doctors to help make decisions about your care. </p>

    <h3>Will I get paid for taking part in this study?</h3>
    <p>People who complete the entire study will receive $600 for their time.</p>
